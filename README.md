File permissions in Linux

In this project, we'll explore how to manage file permissions using Linux commands. This includes checking file and directory details, describing the permissions string, changing file permissions, changing file permissions on a hidden file, and changing directory permissions.

Check file and directory details

First, we'll navigate to the directory where our files are located and list their details along with the permissions using the ls -l command.

Describe the permissions string

The permissions string consists of ten characters, indicating the file type and the read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.

Change file permissions

We'll use the chmod command to modify the permissions of a specific file according to our requirements. This involves changing the read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.

Change file permissions on a hidden file

Similarly, we'll demonstrate how to change the permissions of a hidden file using the chmod command, ensuring that the appropriate permissions are set.

Change directory permissions

Additionally, we'll learn how to change the permissions of a directory using the chmod command, allowing or restricting access to the directory for different users.

Summary

In summary, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how to manage file permissions in Linux, covering various scenarios such as modifying permissions for files, including hidden files, and directories.
